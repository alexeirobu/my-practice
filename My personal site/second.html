        Diabetes is a defect in </h1>the body’s ability to convert glucose (sugar) to energy. Glucose is the main source of fuel for our body.
When food is digested it is changed into fats, protein, or carbohydrates. Foods that affect blood sugars are called carbohydrates.
Carbohydrates, when digested, change to glucose. Examples of some carbohydrates are: bread, rice, pasta, potatoes, corn, fruit,
and milk products. Individuals with diabetes should eat carbohydrates but must do so in moderation.
Glucose is then transferred to the blood and is used by the cells for energy. In order for glucose to be transferred from the
blood into the cells, the hormone - insulin is needed. Insulin is produced by the beta cells in the pancreas (the organ that
produces insulin).
In individuals with diabetes, this process is impaired. Diabetes develops when the pancreas fails to produce sufficient quantities
of insulin – Type 1 diabetes or the insulin produced is defective and cannot move glucose into the cells – Type 2 diabetes.
Either insulin is not produced in sufficient quantities or the insulin produced is defective and cannot move the glucose into
the cells.

        <h1> There are two main types of diabetes:</h1>
        <p>Type 1 diabetes occurs most frequently in children and young adults, although it can occur at any age. Type 1 diabetes accounts
for 5-10% of all diabetes in the United States. There does appear to be a genetic component to Type 1 diabetes, but the
cause has yet to be identified.
Type 2 diabetes is much more common and accounts for 90-95% of all diabetes. Type 2 diabetes primarily affects adults, however
recently Type 2 has begun developing in children. There is a strong correlation between Type 2 diabetes, physical inactivity and
obesity. </p>
